==== Pin Placement

Preferrably, don't place pins at the top or bottom. Place them on the left or
right side of a symbol instead.

==== Pin Order

When designing symbols, pins can be ordered in one of four ways:

1. *Sorted logically*
  - Advantage: Schematics are easily readable because they represent the
    _logic_ of the circuit
  - This should probably be the default choice in most cases
2. *On both sides, sorted numerically counterclockwise*
  - Advantage: Can be solved using very generic symbols. Only one symbol per
    pin count is required (e.g. "IC with 10 Pins", "IC with 12 Pins", "IC with
    14 Pins", â€¦)
3. *Split logically* (one dedicated symbol for each logical part of the component)
  - Advantage: Especially useful for very large components (>100 Pins) to keep
    schematics readable 
4. *Matching the physical design*
  - This is rarely useful, since a symbol should be a logical representation
    of the electrical connections, but there may be cases where it makes
    sense.
